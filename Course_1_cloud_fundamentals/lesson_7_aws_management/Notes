1. Logging In The Cloud: Logging provides visibility into your cloud resources and applications. For applications that run in the cloud, you will need access to logging and auditing services to help you proactively monitor your resources and applications.

	- Logging allows you to answer important questions like:

		- How is this server performing?
		- What is the current load on the server?
		- What is the root cause of an application error that a user is seeing?
		- What is the path that leads to this error?
		
2. Cloud Trail: Cloud Trail allows you to audit (or review) everything that occurs in your AWS account. Cloud Trail does this by recording all the AWS API calls occurring in your account and delivering a log file to you.

	- Features - CloudTrail provides event history of your AWS account activity, including:

		- who has logged in
		- services that were accessed
		- actions performed
		- parameters for the actions
		- responses returned
		- This includes actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools, and other AWS services.

	- Tips
		- Cloud Trail is found under the Management & Governance section on the AWS Management Console.
		- CloudTrail shows results for the last 90 days.
		- You can create up to five trails in an AWS region.
		
3. Cloud Watch: Cloud Watch is a service that monitors resources and applications that run on AWS by collecting data in the form of logs, metrics, and events.

	- Features
		- There are several useful features:
		- Collect and track metrics
		- Collect and monitor log files
		- Set alarms and create triggers to run your AWS resources
		- React to changes in your AWS resources

	- Tips
		- CloudWatch is found under the Management & Governance section on the AWS Management Console.
		- Metrics are provided automatically for a number of AWS products and services.
		
4. Cloud Watch Lab: In this hands-on exercise, you will create a Cloud Watch event to notify via an SNS topic when an EC2 instance is created.


	- Prerequisites:
		
		- AWS account

		- SNS Topic created in previous lab

	- Topics Covered: By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

		- Create Cloud Watch event to react to the creation of an Amazon EC2 instance
		- Send SNS notification via Cloud Watch when an event occurs

	- Steps:
		
		1. Create CloudWatch Rule
			
			- On the AWS Management Console page, type cloud watch in the Find Services box and then select CloudWatch. The CloudWatch Dashboard appears.
			- On the left-hand menu, under Events, select Rules.
			- Click Create rule.
			- For Service Name, select EC2.
			- For the Event Type, select EC2 Instance State-change Notification.
			- Select the Specific state(s) radio button. Select running from the drop-down box. Note: This configures the rule to trigger whenever an Amazon EC2 instance changes to the running state, which happens when an instance is launched or started.
			- On the right-hand side of the screen, in the Target section, add a target by clicking on Add target.
			- In the drop-down, change Lambda function to SNS topic.
			- For the Topic, select the topic you created in the SNS hands-on exercise. Important: If the Topic doesn’t appear, the Access policy – optional section doesn’t have the correct permissions to allow other services to access the Topic.
			- Scroll down and click the Configure details.
			- Enter a name in the Name field. Ensure the state is Enabled. Click Create rule.
			
		2. Test CloudWatch Rule
			
			- Navigate to the EC2 console page, by clicking on Services in the upper left-hand menu. Type EC2 in the text box and click on EC2 found in the search results.
			- On the EC2 Dashboard page, click on Instances in the left-hand navigation.
			- Click Launch Instance.
			- Select the Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM), SSD Volume Type Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Important: You are free to choose a different AMI, but to avoid excessive charges, pick one that says, Free Tier Eligible.
			- For the Instance Type, select the free-tier instance type of t2.micro.
			- Click Review and Launch.
			- Click Launch.
			- Generate and download a new key pair and then launch the instance.
			- Click Launch Instances.
			- Click on View Instances.
			- Once the Instance state changes to Running, check your email client for an email alert from the SNS Topic.
			
		3. Cleanup & Disable EC2 Instance and Cloud Watch Rule
			- To avoid recurring charges for leaving an instance running, let’s disable the EC2 instance.
			- From the EC2 Dashboard, select the instance just created, click Actions, then Instance State, and then select Terminate.
			- To avoid recurring charges for leaving the Cloud Watch rule running, let’s disable it.
			- From the SNS Dashboard, select Rules from under the Events section.
			- Select the Rule you just created, by clicking the radio button next to the Rule.
			- Click on the Actions button, and select Delete.
			
5. Infrastructure as Code: Infrastructure as Code allows you to describe and provision all the infrastructure resources in your cloud environment. You can stand up servers, databases, runtime parameters, resources, etc. based on scripts that you write. Infrastructure as Code is a time-saving feature because it allows you to provision (or stand up) resources in a reproducible way.

6. Cloud Formation: AWS Cloud Formation allows you to model your entire infrastructure in a text file template allowing you to provision AWS resources based on the scripts you write.

	- Tips
		- Cloud Formation is found under the Management & Governance section on the AWS Management Console.
		- Cloud Formation templates are written using JSON or YAML.
		- You can still individually manage AWS resources that are part of a CloudFormation stack.

7. CloudFormation Lab: In this hands-on exercise, you will create an S3 bucket with AWS CloudFormation.

	- Prerequisites:

					"Ref": "S3BucketCreatedByCloudFormation"
				  },
				  "Description": "Name of the newly created Amazon S3 Bucket"
				}
			  }
			}


			- Hit the Refresh button in the upper right-hand corner so that the Designer is not out of date.
